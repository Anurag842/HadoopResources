(divides It will collect data from buckets in a distributed fashion.
( Eg- if you take a tablesample from a table of 4 buckets. It will divide them into two groups of two buckets each and
then take a tablesample from the first bucket of each group so that the information is homogenous))

select deptno, empname,sal,location from dept_buck tablesample(2 percent);

select deptno, empname,sal,location from dept_buck tablesample(1M);

select deptno, empname,sal,location from dept_buck tablesample(20 rows);
